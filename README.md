Task 2- Create a module(API based) that takes a hospital discharge summary as an image or pdf and predicts whether itâ€™s a valid summary or not.

In Sentiment_Analysis.IPYNb analysis we are trying to read the image and convert the text in the image to string , and found a summary of the string. The summary of the paragraph is give as input to the TF-IDF technique to convert the word into a vector after converting it is given as input to the logistice regression classifier model which predicts whether the given image is valid or invalid. 

In app.py we have implemented a api model for the same.
